**Detection of ECB** - Repetiition is the identifier for ecb - remember how it works 
**Detection of the block size** - playing with the input output changing aaaaaaaaaaaaa to aaaaaaBaaaaa something going to change in the bytes or a gup in repetition the hole made is the size of a block
**Detection of Offset** - where our string of data is placed ? the number of characters u can change at the beggining of the payload is the offset from the begging of the whole encrypted string
the number of character u can change on the end of your payload is tthe offset from the end 
the offset is recognized by the server logic responding to your cookie or cipher changes.

PadBuster -tool from GDS to explode the padding oracle attack

Using Crypto 
for data in flight => TLS 
for data in rest => PGP

Do not :
Mac then Encrypt - u open to attacks
Use hash instead of MAC => u enable hash extention atacks
reuse iv key or key-nonce pairs => open yourself to multitude of issues
Use ECB there is no use for this  from all u should know !
