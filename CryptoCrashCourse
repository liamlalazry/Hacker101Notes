### xor

xor has a property that makes it massively important part of crypto:
The ability to reverse itself.

Types of Encyption
Symmetric - Both sides shares the same key 
 - Stream - Encrypts byte by byte
 - Block - Encrypts block by block
Asymmetric - Each side has their own private key and exchanging their public keys

**Stream ciphers** 
for example RC4 which is commonly used in SSL 
to encrypt - random number generator seeded with your key the resulted bytes xored with each byte of plain text 
to decrypt - xor the ciphertext with the key seeded
in these method the quality of our random (in computers there isnt a real random else a math based random) is the quality/strength of our cipher.

**Block Ciphers**
AES,DES,3DES,TwoFIsh etc are all Block Ciphers unlike stream cipher here the encryption and decryption are usually not the same.
In Block ciphers we split the data to N bytes and encrypt each block seperatly as we cant assume the data s divided by exactly N we add padding to make it round divided
**Block Cipher Modes** -  because block ciphers encrypts block to block many modes trying to make them more secure and serve various goals
ECB Mode - Electronic CodeBook Mode - each block encrypted independtly to produce a cipher block as if two blocks are the same the cipher would ne same.
CBC Mode - plaintext got 1 bit from the previous block to make the result even for same bytes diffrent

####  **Hashes (Hash Functions)**

A **hash** is a one-way mathematical function that takes any input (text, file, password) and turns it into a fixed-length string of characters.  
Key points:

- **One-way**: you _cannot_ reverse it to get the original input.
    
- **Deterministic**: same input → same hash.
    
- **Sensitive**: tiny change in input → completely different hash (“avalanche effect”).
    
- **Uses**: password storage, integrity checks, digital signatures.
    

Think of it as a digital fingerprint.
## **Asymmetric Encryption**

Asymmetric encryption uses **two keys**:

- **Public key** → encrypt
    
- **Private key** → decrypt
    

You can share the public key with anyone, but the private key stays secret.

Key points:

- Enables secure communication without sharing a secret key beforehand.
    
- Also used for **digital signatures**:
    
    - Sign with **private key**
        
    - Verify with **public key**
        

Common algorithms: RSA, ECC.


#### MACs 
Message auth code - based on hashes (mostly) with amac u can ensure that your data didnt got tampered with as well validating that the mac itself hasnt manipulated as it has a key for his itself validation
**HMAC**  - type of mac validation -  HMAC(key,message) = hash(key ,hash(key,message))
