Use BCrypt for your passwd storage if not Bcrypt so sha256 with PBKDF2 using per user salt with atleast 10000 rounds

**Our Goals** when making a password storage 
- impervious to rainbow tables (tables with premade hashes of passwords the attacker use to compare with)
-  Hard to computation (חישוב) so brute force would be not practical 
- Unique password for each user

MD5 and SHA family are fast to produce its a upside when it comes to file comparing and validation but it bad for hiding a password and it means brute forcing the hash is fast too.
instead PBKDF1 & 2 performing thoussands of rounds of these simple hashes to build up a strong hash.

Salting - adding random avalue to the password to make  rainbow tables useless
if done do not use the same salt for every hash we dont want to reach the same hash twice for example.
